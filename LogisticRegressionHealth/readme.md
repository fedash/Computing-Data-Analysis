# Predictive Modeling for Heart Transplant Outcomes and Heart Failure Risks using Logistic Regression

This project explores the application of logistic regression for predicting heart transplant outcomes and assessing heart failure risks. Leveraging medical datasets and implementing optimization techniques like Gradient Ascent and Newton's method, the analysis aims to derive meaningful decision boundaries and insights.

## Data Used

- **Heart Transplant Dataset**: This dataset comprises various health metrics and outcomes of heart transplant procedures, serving as the basis for our predictive model.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Imported the heart transplant dataset to set the stage for the analysis.
2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Conducted an initial analysis to understand the data's structure and prepared it for modeling.
3. **Mathematical Foundations**: Discussed the mathematical concepts underpinning logistic regression including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
4. **Model Implementation**: 
    - Built a logistic regression model using Gradient Ascent.
    - Explored Newton's method as an alternative optimization technique.
5. **Evaluation and Interpretation**: 
    - Visualized decision boundaries through contour plots.
    - Interpreted the paths of convergence for both optimization techniques.

## Packages Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and performance metrics.

## Final Remarks

The project serves as a comprehensive guide to logistic regression with a focus on its application in the medical domain. Both Gradient Ascent and Newton's method were implemented for optimization, providing valuable insights into their respective efficiencies and trade-offs. The visualizations, especially the contour plots, were instrumental in understanding model performance.
