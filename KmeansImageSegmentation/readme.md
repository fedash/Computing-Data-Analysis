# K-means Clustering Mini-Project

This project offers an in-depth exploration of the K-means clustering algorithm, covering its theoretical foundations, practical applications, and optimizations. It serves as a complete guide to understanding the K-means algorithm and its applications in various domains like synthetic data clustering, species classification, and even image segmentation.

## Data Used

- **Synthetic Data**: Randomly generated 2D data points used for the initial demonstration of the algorithm.
- **[Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)**: A famous dataset used in pattern recognition literature.
- **Image Data**: A JPEG image used to demonstrate the application of K-means in image segmentation.

## Key Steps

1. **Introduction**: Provided an overview of K-means and its applications.
2. **Data Preparation**: Loaded and explored datasets, including synthetic data and the Iris dataset.
3. **Mathematical Concepts**: Introduced the math behind K-means, complete with formulas and pseudocode.
4. **K-means from Scratch**: Implemented the K-means algorithm from scratch and applied it to synthetic and Iris data.
5. **K-means on Image**: Demonstrated the application of K-means in image segmentation.
6. **Optimization**: Used the Elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

## Packages Used

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualizations.
- `scikit-learn`: For loading datasets and using the K-means implementation.
- `OpenCV`: For image processing tasks.

## Conclusion

The project not only demonstrates the versatility of the K-means algorithm but also gives an under-the-hood look by implementing it from scratch. The Elbow method for optimization and application on image data show the algorithm's wide range of applicability. This work serves as a comprehensive guide to K-means, making it a valuable addition to any data science portfolio.
