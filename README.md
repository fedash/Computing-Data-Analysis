### 4. ECommerce Data Analysis and Visualization
In this project, I delved deep into e-commerce data, focusing on customer behavior, order flows, and product insights. Through various analytical methods and visualization techniques, key trends like preferred payment methods, state-wise order distribution, and product preferences were highlighted. Detailed geographic visualizations were employed to showcase data on the map of Brazil, providing a comprehensive spatial view of e-commerce patterns.
