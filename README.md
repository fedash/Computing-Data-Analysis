### 4. ECommerce Data Analysis and Visualization
In this project, I delved deep into e-commerce data, focusing on customer behavior, order flows, and product insights. Through various analytical methods and visualization techniques, key trends like preferred payment methods, state-wise order distribution, and product preferences were highlighted. Detailed geographic visualizations were employed to showcase data on the map of Brazil, providing a comprehensive spatial view of e-commerce patterns.

### 5. Logistic Regression Analysis on Heart Transplant and Heart Failure Cases

In this project, I took a deep dive into predicting heart transplant success using logistic regression. The data set consists of multiple patient features like age, blood type, and medical history. The real kicker here was optimizing the model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) methods, where I compared the performance of Gradient Ascent and Newton's Method. The findings were visualized with contour plots and likelihood trajectories, giving a graphical gist of how well each method performs.

### 6. K-means Clustering and Image Segmentation
In this project, I explored the intricacies of the K-means clustering algorithm by implementing it from scratch. I started with a thorough mathematical foundation and moved on to apply the algorithm to synthetic and Iris datasets. Further, the algorithm's versatility is showcased through its application in image segmentation. The elbow method is utilized to identify the optimal number of clusters, and all findings are meticulously visualized to provide a well-rounded understanding of the technique.
