# ECommerce Data Analysis
This project is centered around analyzing and visualizing e-commerce data, focusing on order details, customer information, and product specifications. The analysis aims to derive insights on various aspects such as the most preferred payment method, delivery time analysis, and state-wise order distributions, utilizing Python's powerful libraries such as Pandas and Plotly.

## Overview
- **Data Handling:**
  - Extensive use of Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
  - Merging multiple datasets to form a comprehensive dataframe for analysis.
- **Data Analysis:**
  - Analysis of customer and order information.
  - Investigating relationships between different variables such as product description length and spending categories.
  - Exploring the delivery time and its relation with other variables.
- **Visualization:**
  - Creation of multiple visualizations including heatmaps and geographic plots.
  - Usage of Plotly for interactive and informative visualizations.
  - Visualization of order flows between cities and distribution of other variables on the map of Brazil.

## Main Steps:
1. **Data Merging:**
   - Merged various datasets related to customers, orders, payments, and products.
2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Explored the merged dataset to understand the distribution and relationship among variables.
3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Applied various transformations to derive new features and prepare data for analysis.
4. **Analytical Visualization:**
   - Developed heatmaps and geographic visualizations to display the distribution of various variables and insights.
5. **Geographic Analysis:**
   - Plotted order flows between cities and state-wise distribution of various factors.

## Packages Used:
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** For numerical operations.
- **plotly:** For creating interactive visualizations.
- **scipy:** For statistical analysis.
- **geopandas:** For working with geospatial data.
